      <p class="pb-1">This research project investigated how to develop an interactive learning tool to educate patients with type 2 diabetes about continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). The tool runs real-life scenarios that visualize how meal and lifestyle choices affect glucose trajectories in both healthy patients and patients with type 2 diabetes. It is intended that the tool will be used by the clinician to engage the patient in an educational discussion about CGM. From this discussion the patient would then apply what they learned to their own CGM data. The effectiveness of this learning tool was evaluated during interviews with health professionals who directly interact with patients with type 2 diabetes. The results of the interviews will be applied to the prototype to develop a refined learning tool, which will ultimately be made available as a clinician-guided tool in the clinic and as a stand-alone tool through the web. This research project was in collaborated with Rasa Kazlauskaite, M.D., at the Rush University Prevention Center in Chicago, Illinois.</p>

      <p class="pb-2">The image above is a still from the interactive learning tool showing the normal 24-hour glucose trajectory in a person without diabetes. The events highlighted include the overnight fasting glucose and three meal actions on glucose. These events stay within the “on target” range, shown as a grey bar. It is important for a patient with type 2 diabetes to understand normal glucose behaviors so they may better understand how diabetes alters these baseline behaviors.</p>
